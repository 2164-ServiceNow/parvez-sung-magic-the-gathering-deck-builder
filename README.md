# Project Title: Magic: The Gathering Deckbuilder

**Project Description:** Magic: The Gathering (MTG) Deckbuilder is a web application that leverages the 
Magic: The Gathering API to help players create and organize custom MTG decks. Users can search for 
cards or booster sets and make selections for deck-building. The application also informs both new 
and veteran players about keywords and card details, reducing the learning curve and making the game 
more accessible. By providing an optimized deckbuilding experience, this project aims to foster a 
welcoming community for Magic: The Gathering enthusiasts. 

**Technologies Used:**

*   HTML - v5
*   CSS - v3
*   JavaScript - ECMAScript6
*	NodeJS - v20.11.0
*   AngularJS - v1.8.2
*   Bootstrap CSS Framework - v5.3
*   Magic the Gathering API - https://docs.magicthegathering.io/

**User Stories:** (8 Total - 4 Per Developer)

1.  Card Search 
    As a user, I can query for Magic: The Gathering cards so that I can learn more about them.
2.  Booster Sets Search
    As a user, I can query for Magic: The Gathering booster sets so that I can learn more about their contents and potential card pulls.
3.  Keyword Queries
    As a user, I can query for certain keywords (i.e. 'flying', or 'trample') so that I can learn more about them and better understand the game's mechanics when building my deck.
4.  Deck Assembly
    As a user, I can add or remove cards in a deck so that I can build a deck without needing physical cards.
5.  Deck Statistics
    As a user, I can view the statistics of my deck and cards (such as mana costs or card types) so that I can judge what cards to add or remove from my deck as part of my strategy.
6.  Favorite Cards 
    As a user, I can favorite/save cards so that I can make and organize a wishlist.
7.  Save and Revisit Deck
    As a user, I can save my deck's information so that I can come back to the deckbuilder if I ever want to view or edit my deck at a later time.
8.  Playtest Mode 
    As a user, I can simulate a playtest of my deck so that I can identify flaws or synergies by virtually playing with my cards. At the start of the playtest, the deck should shuffle, and I should draw a random 7-card starting hand.
    (Optional advanced features: battlefield, graveyard, exile, and commander zones; tapping cards; adding custom counters on cards.)
